# Lobstero API
 An exceedingly simple (and very small) API for serving arbitrary files to lobstero. That is literally all it does.

### Usage
1. Install fastapi, its dependencies, and aiofiles if you haven't already. You can do this with pip.
2. Make some directories (in the same folder as this file) and add their names to paths.toml. Put some random files in them.
3. Run `uvicorn main:app`. That's literally it.
